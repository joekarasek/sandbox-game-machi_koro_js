      <h2>Machi Koro Rules</h2>
      <p>Each player starts with two establishments (one Wheat Field and one Bakery) and 3 coins.
      <br>
      You will also have four Landmark cards (Train Station, Shopping Mall, Amusement Park, Radio Tower) that will be under construction.</p>

      <h2>Game Flow</h2>
      <ul>A turn consists of the following three phases:
        <br>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Roll Dice:</strong> to begin their turn a player rolls the dice. When rolling two dice, the dice are always summed together.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Earn Income:</strong> Players earn income based on the dice roll and the effects of the Establishments that they own that match the dice roll.</li>
          <ul>There are 3 different types of establishments:
          <li>BLUE: Get income from the bank on ANYONE'S turn.</li>
          <li>GREEN: Get income from the bank ONLY on your turn.</li>
          <li>RED: Take coins from the person that rolled the dice. As long as that person has coins to give.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>**If you own multiple copies of a single Establishment, the effects are multiplied by the number of Establishments of that type owned.</p>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Construction:</strong>
        Buy Establishments or Landmarks from the marketplace after you rolled the dice and earn and/or give income. You can only buy one Establishment or Landmark on your turn. Or you may choose to end your turn.</li>
        <br>
      <p>Game End: The player to construct all four of their Landmarks first wins the game!</p>
