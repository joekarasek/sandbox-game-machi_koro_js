<h2>Machi Koro Rules</h2>
<p>Each player starts with two establishments (one Wheat Field and one Bakery).
<br>
You will also have four Landmark cards (Train Station, Shopping Mall, Amusement Park, Radio Tower) that will be under construction.</p>

<h2>GAME FLOW</h2>
<p>A turn consists of the following three phases:
<br>
Roll Dice: to begin their turn a player rolls the dice. When rolling two dice, the dice are always summed together.
<br>
Earn Income: Players earn income based on the dice roll and the effects of the Establishments that they own that match the dice roll.
There are 3 different types of establishments:
<br>
BLUE: Get income from the bank on ANYONE'S turn.
GREEN: Get income from the bank ONLY on your turn.
RED: Take coins from the person that rolled the dice. As long as that person has coins to give.
<br>
**If you own multiple copies of a single Establishment, the effects are multiplied by the number of Establishments of that type owned.
<br>
Construction:
Buy Establishments or Landmarks from the marketplace after you rolled the dice and earn and/or give income. You can only buy one Establishment or Landmark on your turn. Or you may choose to end your turn.
<br>
Game End: The player to construct all four of their Landmarks first wins the game!</p>
