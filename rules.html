          <p>Each player starts with two establishments (one Wheat Field and one Bakery) and 3 coins.
          <br>
          You will also have four Landmark cards (Train Station, Shopping Mall, Amusement Park, Radio Tower) that will be under construction.</p>

          <h2>Game Flow</h2>
          <ul>A turn consists of the following three phases:
            <br>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Roll Dice:</strong> to begin their turn a player rolls the dice. When rolling two dice, the dice are always summed together.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Earn Income:</strong> Players earn income based on the dice roll and the effects of the Establishments that they own that match the dice roll.</li>
              <ul>There are 3 different types of establishments:
              <li>BLUE: Get income from the bank on ANYONE'S turn.</li>
              <li>GREEN: Get income from the bank ONLY on your turn.</li>
              <li>RED: Take coins from the person that rolled the dice. As long as that person has coins to give.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>**If you own multiple copies of a single Establishment, the effects are multiplied by the number of Establishments of that type owned.</p>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Construction:</strong>
            Buy Establishments or Landmarks from the marketplace after you rolled the dice and earn and/or give income. You can only buy one Establishment or Landmark on your turn. Or you may choose to end your turn.</li>
            <br>
        </div>
        <div class="well">
          <p>Game End: The player to construct all four of their Landmarks first wins the game!</p>
